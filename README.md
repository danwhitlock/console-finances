**Description**

This is a challenge to output financial information from a selection of data using JavaScript.

Data was provided in the format 

    var finances = [
        ['Jan-2010', 867884],
        ['Feb-2010', 984655],
        ['Mar-2010', 322013],
        ['Apr-2010', -69417]
        ... ]

The challenge was to identify the following information and report it in the console - 

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period
- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period
